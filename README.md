These scripts require an excel spreadsheet with metadata for electrophysiological recordings. 
They will extract the data and relevant files from the appropriate directory and perform analysis on different features of direction selectivity.
The relevant functions to calculate DSI, VS, etc. are located at the bottom of each script and are adapted from DSGC-Velocity-Project
